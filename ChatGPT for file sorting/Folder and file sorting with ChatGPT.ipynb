However we can now conclude that a manual sort just done by chatGPT yields the best results, at least in this scenario where files had clear descriptive names, but followed no naming conventions. For larger unsorted file systems \n",

    "My hypothesis is that this would work way worse for an original set of files with less descriptive names.

An example of this might be Microsoft's coming Office 365 co-pilot.\n",
